# 🖼️ StegoHideX — Project Overview

## 🧠 Concept

StegoHideX is a Windows desktop application that allows users to **hide files inside images** using **modern steganography techniques**. Users can embed any file (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .zip) within common image formats (e.g., .png, .jpg), and later extract them with or without password protection.

## 🎯 Goals

- Create an intuitive GUI for file/image selection
- Support drag-and-drop file loading
- Utilize robust steganographic embedding algorithms (LSB, F5, or Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation)
- Ensure embedded images appear unchanged visually
- Offer optional encryption of embedded content
- Allow file extraction with or without password

## 🧑 Target Audience

- Cybersecurity enthusiasts
- Developers and educators
- Privacy-conscious users
- Puzzle & ARG creators
